	<h1>my mom is my mom</h1>
	<p>she's a doctor. she has never been awful to me. she's 67 i think. she looks 55, by white woman standards. i love
		her and she's supportive</p>
	<p>she also guilt trips me. i think it's her job as a mother. if i become a father i'll probably guilt trip a little
		too. i guess my dad doesn't do that but whatever</p>
	<h3>we are on great terms</h3>
