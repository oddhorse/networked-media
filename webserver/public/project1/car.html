	<h1>i am in the car and i am sixteen years old</h1>
	<p>my sense of time changed once i was able to drive. now i could see anything or anyone and do whatever i wanted to

	<h2>my car &lt;3</h2>
	<img src="car/4spots.jpeg" alt="my car, parked in four spots at once">
	<p>this is my car. </p>
	<p>...this naturally leads to my <a href="room.html">room</a>, or back <a href="index.html">home</a></p>
