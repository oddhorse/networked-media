	<h1>i am at the airport and i am so proud of how much it's grown</h1>
	<p>it's the first thing i see when i get back home and i barely recognize it every time. i take cheap flights that
		get in late at night so i have a fairly limited view. my parents pick me up so i'm not required to look out at the
		road anyway. i'm also strung out on caffeine and lack of sleep and plane-drudge but i still notice how i no longer
		remember the route to leave the atlanta airport by car. i never do, and it's not a matter of memory. they renovate
		the last path away every six months, just to punish my absence.</p>
	<p>when i'm back home i have to carry my suitcase up the stairs, once from the garage and again up to my <a
			href="../room.html">room</a>. every time i'm back my suitcases are heavier than
		ever and my parents are weaker than ever. taking care of things for them is not a problem but i didn't expect to
		start this early</p>
	<p>...this naturally leads to the <a href="roads.html">roads</a>, or back to the <a href="../city.html">city</a></p>
