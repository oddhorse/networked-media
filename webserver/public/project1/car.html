	<h1>i am in the car and i am sixteen years old</h1>


	<h2>my car &lt;3</h2>
	<img src="car/4spots.jpeg" alt="my car, parked in four spots at once">
	<p>this is my car (technically it's my parents', but i'm the only one who drives it). 2008 hybrid honda civic. i
		think it has several names but i keep forgetting and asking people to rename it. my mom most recently named it
		<b>scooby</b> i think
	</p>
	<h2>scars</h2>
	<p>my sense of time changed once i was able to drive. now i could see anything or anyone and do whatever i wanted to
		(relatively). living became more rapid. there was suddenly much much more life out there.</p>
	<p>as the main enabler of my later teenage years, scooby bears maybe more of that time's scars than i do.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>there is a vintage beanie baby mcdonalds toy in my car, a worm named <b>inch</b>. shelby gave him to me before
			i left for college. shelby and i aren't friends anymore but inch and i are doing just fine</li>
		<li>there is a small dent in the car's hood. a deer ran in front of my car once and i hit it head-on. the deer and
			i walked our separate ways. it's a short tale but my car tells it well</li>
		<li>i have a stone mountain year pass stuck onto the windshield from the year 2021. it wasn't mine. diego lent it
			to me off his parents' car for a day we were visiting the mountain and i just forgot to give it back to him. we
			didn't go back that year either</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>items</h2>
	<p>i've driven everyone i know in my car. everybody has left all sorts of things in it. i can usually tell whose
		items
		they are.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>these lensless glasses are something only liv wears</li>
		<li>all these publix employee bonus gift cards are something only mel would carry around</li>
		<li>this navel piercing dayanara got when we were at plaza fiesta and she forgot it in the cupholder</li>
	</ul>
	<p>sometimes it's harder to tell. i would always have to post missing items on my instagram story to see whose they
		were. i never thought about it until right now but i was driving so many friends around all the time that i
		had a lost and found for my car.</p>
	<h2>in my absence my car bears different kinds of scars</h2>
