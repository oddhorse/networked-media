	<h1>i am in my room and i am younger than i have ever been</h1>
	<p>my room is where i feel the youngest. it was built and rebuilt and torn down and further rebuilt by hands that
		were once mine. i am him again when i am back</p>
	<h2>in my room</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>i am small</li>
		<li>i don't know anything</li>
		<li>i don't care about anything</li>
		<li>i'm safe
			<ul>
				<li>safe enough to run from the world</li>
				<li>safe enough to ignore my emails</li>
				<li>safe from everybody but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/mom.html">my
						mother</a>. i don't have a problem with my mother but
					<ul>
						<li>every night before going to bed she knocks on my door. she has nothing in particular to say but
							she knows she needs to say something
							<ul>
								<li>who am i talking to on the phone? <i>i don't want her to know i'm still talking to that girl
										she doesn't like</i></li>
								<li>how are the emails? <i>i'm ashamed of the fact i can't answer emails when i'm living in her
										house. she'll take it personally</i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>safe from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/oddhorse.html">oddhorse</a></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>i can sleep in my little twin bed</li>
		<li>i can sit at my desk and use my computer and make it do whatever i want it to do</li>
		<li>i can make music if i get over my fear of people perceiving me when i'm singing or making any noise</li>
		<li>i can ignore all my friends' text messages</li>
	</ul>
	<p>in my room i am safe</p>
	<h2>in new york i am a different person</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>i am <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/oddhorse.html">oddhorse</a></li>
		<li>i have an inbox of zero</li>
		<li>everybody knows me and i don't know them</li>
		<li>i am a magical fairy who loves talking to everyone in the world</li>
		<li>i'm safe
			<ul>
				<li>safe from judgement</li>
				<li>safe from quiet moments</li>
				<li>safe from my own thoughts</li>
				<li>safe from everybody but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/mom.html">my
						mother</a>
					<ul>
						<li>my mom got mad at me recently because i wasn't answering her messages. every two hours if i don't
							respond to one she will send many question marks just to make sure i see it. i have no fear in the
							world except for those question marks</li>
						<li>they're for questions like:
							<ul>
								<li>have you made that doctor's appointment? <i>no, i haven't, but fear of the task i'm getting
										from you is worse than my forgetting it</i></li>
								<li>did you see the article i sent? <i>it was probably a fine article but i don't know why i was
										too afraid to open your text at all</i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>i can sleep on my little twin bed</li>
		<li>i can fear my roommates hearing me through the massive ventilation gaps in my room walls</li>
		<li>i am the cutthroat hustler this city requires of me</li>
	</ul>
	<p>in new york i am successful</p>

	<p>my history and my past are all around me in my room. i could tear it all down and throw it all away, but who would
		i be if my past no longer existed? maybe i need to keep it somewhere far away. so i can be somebody it's not,
		rather than nobody at all.</p>

	<h2>maybe at home i am who i really am. if so, i don't like who i am at all. maybe, for my own good, i should never
		go home
		again.</h2>
