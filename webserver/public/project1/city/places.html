	<h1>i am in places and i remember all the things i never remember</h1>
	<p>i have memories so tied to this place that being there is the only thing that brings them back.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>driving home and realizing i'm on the route i used to take to leave <a target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/moira.html">moira</a>'s house</li>
		<li>a clearing we all had a particularly good picnic at</li>
		<li>my favorite gas station that used to be in a bad area but it's really not recognizable anymore</li>
	</ul>

	<p>i'm not allowed in here anymore. they won't do anything if i go in but i'll probably die or something because i
		used to work here. they're all good memories and usually i'm not one to fear good memories. but here i do.</p>
