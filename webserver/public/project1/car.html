	<h2>my car &lt;3</h2>

	<caption>my car</caption>
	<p>2008 hybrid honda civic. i
		think it has several names but i keep forgetting and asking people to rename it. <a target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/mom.html">my
			mom</a> most recently named it
		<b>scooby</b> i think
	</p>

	<h2>scars</h2>
	<p>my sense of time changed once i was able to drive. now i could see anything or anyone and do whatever i wanted to
		(relatively). living became more rapid. there was suddenly much much more life out there.</p>
	<p>as the main enabler of my later teenage years, my car bears maybe more of that time's scars than i do.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>there is a vintage beanie baby mcdonalds toy in my car, a worm named <b>inch</b>. <a target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/shelby.html">shelby</a> gave him to me before
			i left for college. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/shelby.html">shelby</a> and i
			aren't friends anymore but inch and i are doing just fine</li>
		<li>there is a small dent in the car's hood. a deer ran in front of my car once and i hit it head-on. the deer and
			i walked our separate ways. it's a short tale but my car tells it well</li>
		<li>i have a stone mountain year pass stuck onto the windshield from the year 2021. it wasn't mine. <a
				target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="people/diego.html">diego</a> lent it
			to me off his parents' car for a day we were visiting the mountain and i just forgot to give it back to him. we
			didn't go back that year either</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>items</h2>
	<p>i've driven everyone i know in my car. everybody has left all sorts of things in it. i can usually tell whose
		items
		they are.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>these lensless glasses are something only <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
				href="people/liv.html">liv</a> wears</li>
		<li>all these publix employee bonus gift cards are something only mel would carry around</li>
		<li>this navel piercing dayanara got when we were at plaza fiesta and she forgot it in the cupholder</li>
	</ul>
	<p>sometimes it's harder to tell. i would always have to post missing items on my instagram story to see whose they
		were. i never thought about it until right now but i was driving so many friends around all the time that i
		had a lost and found for my car.</p>
	<h2>sex</h2>
	<p>this car was also the first place i had sex and that's not to say i think of that every time i drive somewhere in
		it but it's such an emotionally heavy thing to tie to a place or an object.</p>
	<p>i guess the car is both a place and an object</p>
	<h2>in my absence my car bears different kinds of scars</h2>
	<img src="car/dirty.jpg" alt="my dirty car">
	<caption>the car is dirty</caption>
	<p>my car has historically been dirty often becuse it lives outside. nobody thinks about it or cleans it except me
	</p>
	<p>but when i'm gone for most of the year it really grows an ecosystem on top every time i'm back. at the car wash
		they charge me for powerwashing it because there's nothing else they can do</p>
	<h3>the mold</h3>
	<p>last time i came back home there was mold in my car. apparently the door seal slipped off a bit and it rained. my
		mom did catch this and they put it in the garage with a dehumidifier. but i still had to brush the dry mold from
		my steering wheel, and it has smelled like mold inside ever since. i don't blame it. old car!</p>
	<p>my mom plans to get it detailed. part of me doesn't want to get it detailed. it's tattoo removal. putting makeup
		over your scars. deleting your browser history.</p>
