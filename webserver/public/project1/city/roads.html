	<h1>i am in my own streets and i am a stranger where i shouldn't be</h1>
	<h2>i love driving everywhere</h2>
	<p>and i love driving without a map when i'm back in atlanta. it's a direct reminder that this is my place. i know
		this place. can i call it home if i couldn't find my way without a map?</p>
	<h2>soon, i guess, i will need to stop calling it home</h2>

	<p>i found this picture to display here. it's the jackson st bridge and one of my favorite places in the city but i
		couldn't remember where it was taken just now.</p>
